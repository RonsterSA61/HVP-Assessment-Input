        <h2>Part 1: World View</h2>
        <p>Please rank the following phrases from best to worst by dragging and dropping them into a new order. Place the phrase you consider 'best' or most positive at the top, and the 'worst' or most negative at the bottom.</p>
	<p>Base your ranking on the goodness or badness of each phrase, not its importance. There's no time limit, but most people finish in about 15 - 20 minutes, so it's best to go with your initial feeling. You may begin.</p>

	<p>Other considerations are on Part 1 of the assessment</p>
